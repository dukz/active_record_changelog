ActiveRecordChangelog
=====================

Logs changes of models whenever they are updated. 

This does not keep versions of records, but just log them out. If you want that feature, check out Paper Trail instead.


Example
=======

  class Movie < ActiveRecord::Base
    log_changes :ignore => [:hits, :updated_at]
  end

  @movie = Movie.find(1)
  @changelogs = @movie.changelogs
  @changelogs.each do |changelog|
    puts changelog.field_changed
    puts changelog.summary
    puts changelog.changer
    puts changelog.updated_at
  end
